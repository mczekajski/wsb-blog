This is a project for my postgraduate studies. It is a simple blog using json-server as back-end which allows user to add, edit and delete posts.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository to your computer.
2. Run `npm install` command to install all necessary packages.
3. Run `npm start` command that concurrently launches json-server for "back-end" and angular front-end application.

## How to use

Database has already couple of posts added which you can edit or delete or basically add new one. You can do this in Admin Panel which is available in top menu. There is no registration or login needed. All changes are being saved in json file locally in your repository.
